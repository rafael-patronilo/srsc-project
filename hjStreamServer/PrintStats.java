// ..... Implement the code

// For the required statistics use this as reference for
// the observations you must print from your new Streaming Server
// implementation to support the RTSSP protocol

    // PrintStats
    // You must implement th code to compute and obtain
    // the statistics and metrics for each received stream
    // processed and delivered by the Box (to the media player)
    // The idea is to capture the necessary instrumentation of
    // received and processed streams using the input variables
    // for PritStats to print (in the end of each streaming) the
    // related experimental observations for practical analysis
    // The idea is to capture the statistics below
