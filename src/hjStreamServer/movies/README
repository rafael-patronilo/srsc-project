These movies are the initial encoded media contents corresponding
to the movies steramed by the initially provided Streamig Server

In your Project implementation remember that the movies must be initially
encrypted, and the Steraming Server must use the necessary cryptographic
configurations to open the related files to check for the integrity, and
if everything is ok, to start the streaming for the movie in each case.
