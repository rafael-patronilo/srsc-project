# This is a brief explanation for the simple comfiguration required
# to setup the hjBox

localdelivery:224.7.7.7:7777
remote:localhost:9999

# For example this parameterization means that the hjBox will
# expect to receive a movie (streaming) from a remote Streaming Server
# running in the machine "localhost" using the UDOP port 9999
# This is what the remote config means.

# The hjBox will forward the received setreams (on corresponding UDP
# datagram packets, to the Multicast address 224.7.7.7, port 7777

# Please note that:
# - the IPaddresses used are IPv4 IP addresses.
# - ports can be selected (in the range of all possible ports, ex: 1025-16383)
#   supported by UDP
# - for localdelivery is also possible to use unicast addresses if you dont
#   want to redisseminate the streaming in multicasting
#   In this case you can use an unicast address and port.


# Interesting:
# Is it possible to use hjProxy to run in a mall device (ex., Raspberry PI)
# to build something as a "Raspberry-Pi Setup Box" ? Yes !
